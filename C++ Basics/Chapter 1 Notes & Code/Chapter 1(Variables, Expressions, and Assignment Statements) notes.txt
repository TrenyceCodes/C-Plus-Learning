    - variable can be declared, which talks to the compiler about what data is stored
        - char: 1 byte
        - bool: 1 byte
        - floating-point number: 4 bytes 
        - int: 4 bytes
        - short int: 2 bytes
        - long int: 4 bytes
        - double: 8 bytes
        - long double: 10 bytes

C++ is a case sensitive language, meaning two variables are different between uppercase and lowercase
